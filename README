SphinxQL for Kohana
===================

Overview
--------

I wrote this because the other Kohana Sphinx plugin on github was reliant on
the pure PHP sphinx API and was discontinued. This plugin, as suggested by its
name, uses the SphinxQL interface. This means there's less dependancies as it
uses the built-in MySQL interface from PHP. _NOTE_: to use this, MySQL server
does _NOT_ need to be installed on the server. Only the MySQL client library for
PHP is required. As the MySQL interface in PHP is built as an extension, it's
faster than the regular Sphinx API as well, you can check the benchmarks out
here: http://sphinxsearch.com/blog/2010/04/25/sphinxapi-vs-sphinxql-benchmark/

Requirements
------------

Sphinx >= 0.9.9-rc2
PHP MySQL client library (php5-mysql in debian)

Installation
------------

1. `git submodule add git://github.com/MasterCJ/kohana-sphinxql.git modules/sphinxql`
2. Enable sphinxql in your bootstrap file
3. Use the SphinxQL class in your models

Usage
-----

	$sphinxql = new SphinxQL();
	$query = $sphinxql->new_query();
	$query->add_index('my_index')
		->add_field('field_name', 'alias')
		->add_fields(array('title_alias' => 'title', 'user_alias' => 'user'))
		->search('some words to search for')
		->where('time', time()-3600, '>')
			// field, value, operator='=', quote=false
		->where_in('tags', array(1, 2, 3))
			// field, array values, all=false
		->order('@weight desc')
		->offset(0)->limit(20);
	$result = $query->execute();

All the methods in SphinxQL_Query are chainable apart from execute(), so
technically this works fine (ugly as it is):

	$result = $sphinxql->new_query()->add_index('news')->order('time', 'desc')->execute();

Note that as with any Sphinx application, you'd need to then go and fetch the
actual data from a datastore somewhere using the IDs you just recieved.

u mad?

All the classes are documented, so there shouldn't be too much confusion. If
you do have questions, concerns, pent up rage, panties or all of the above,
drop me a line at mastercj@mastercj.net or file a bug report.
